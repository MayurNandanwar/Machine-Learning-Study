    "            --line plot is used to plot series of data with respect to time example like what is growth of single stock price\n",
    "            with respect to time like day , hr ,min wise , trend data over period of time \n",
    "            -- similar to scatter plot \n",
    "            \n",
    "Area plot : this plot is based on line plot.\n",
    "            area between axis and line is emphesize by color\n",
    "            compare two or more quantity togather so that by using this plot we can make comparision based on that area\n",

    "hist plot :- it is frequency distribution plot. by this plot we can find out total frequency of data belongs to specific range \n",
    "            -- this divides whole data in to series of interval.\n",
    "            -- hist plot divide total data of column into 10 bin (range) we can add size of bin \n",

    "bar plot :- graph represent categorical data with rectengular bar with hight and width prapotional to values \n",
    "            -- helps to do comparision amongs descrete values \n",
    "            -- two type we can plot horizontal or vertical\n",

    "box plot :- it is statistical representation of data by using that we can find out minimum value from perticulat data column\n",
    "            -- we can get midian , 25 percentile , 75 percentile , Inter quantile range , max value and alfo outlire \n",
    "            --> how can we consider that this data point is out lire ?--> data above max value and min value in box plot \n",
    "                we can say because we find out max = 75 percentile + 1.5 IQR , min = 25 percentile - 1.5 IQR \n",
    "                so any point not fall within this max and min that is outlire.\n",
